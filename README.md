# Lysand Protocol

## Introduction

The Lysand Protocol is meant to be a protocol for federated applications to communicate with each other using the HTTP stack. It is meant to be a simple protocol that is easy to implement and understand.

Unlike ActivityPub, Lysand includes many more out of the box features designed for social media applications. It is also designed to be more secure and private by default.

Lysand tries to be as standardized and possible and discourage use of vendor-specific implementations, such as what Mastodon has done with ActivityPub. It is based on simple JSON objects and HTTP requests, with no need for complex serialization formats.

TypeScript types are provided in this repository for every object in the protocol, which can be easily adapted to other languages.

## Protocol

Lysand tries to have similar concepts to already existing popular protocols, such as ActivityPub and ActivityStreams. However, it is not compatible with either of them. It is also not compatible with ActivityPub's JSON-LD serialization format.

Lysand-compatible servers may implement other protocols as well, such as ActivityPub, but they are not required to do so.
